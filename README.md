## üîß Installation

1. Download the latest version of the app:  
üëâ [Releases Page](https://github.com/Navaneeth-Git/CloudBooth/releases)

2. Locate the downloaded file:  
`CloudBooth.app.zip`

3. **Double-click** the `.zip` file to extract `CloudBooth.app`.

4. **(Recommended)** Drag `CloudBooth.app` into your `/Applications` folder.

5. Since the app is **not signed or notarized**, you need to **dequarantine** it:

   Open **Terminal**, type the following command, and **drag the app from Applications into Terminal**:

   ```bash
   xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine 
   ```

   Press `Return`.

6. After this, you can open CloudBooth normally and start syncing.

## üîë Folder Access Permissions

To function correctly, **CloudBooth will request access multiple times** for the following locations:

- `~/Pictures/Photo Booth Library` (read access)
- Destination folder (iCloud Drive or custom location - write access)

> **You must grant full permission to every folder prompt** for the app to work correctly.

---

## üîê Privacy & Security

- **CloudBooth never accesses or uploads your personal files to any third-party services.**
- It **only copies media files** from the local Photo Booth library to your selected destination folder.
- No network activity or data harvesting.  
- All operations are strictly local and private within your Apple ecosystem.

---

## üß© How It Works

CloudBooth monitors your Photo Booth Library at:

```bash
~/Pictures/Photo Booth Library
```

It detects new files (based on your sync preference) and copies them to:

- `/Users/[username]/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/CloudBooth` (iCloud), or
- A custom folder you choose.

You can also manually sync anytime using the **Sync Now** button.

## üí° Notes

- CloudBooth runs silently in the background. Check the menu bar for status and controls.
- The sync history tab tracks all your past syncs (success & failure).
- Remember: Auto-sync will only run if the app is kept running in the background.
